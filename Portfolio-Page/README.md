# My First Responsive Personal Portfolio Webpage

## Project Overview

This project is a responsive personal portfolio webpage built to meet the assignment objective: **to create a modern, responsive website using only pure HTML and CSS, while utilizing AI tools to accelerate development.**

It successfully showcases my foundational skills in web development and my ability to integrate AI assistance into the development workflow while maintaining code quality and adherence to project constraints.

## 🌟 Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For content structure and semantics.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsiveness (via media queries).
* **No Frameworks, Libraries, or JavaScript** were used, in strict compliance with the assignment objective.

## 🤖 AI Tool Usage (Required by Assignment)

In line with the assignment guidelines to use AI website-building tools to speed up development, the primary AI tool leveraged for this project was **v0.dev**.

| Tool Used | Purpose in Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **v0.dev** | Used to generate initial component structures and base CSS layouts (e.g., hero section, navigation bar). |

The use of v0.dev served as a valuable starting point, providing a draft structure that was then rigorously reviewed and manually improved.

## ✍️ Manual Changes and Improvements

As required by the objective ("...but you must review, fix, and improve the generated code manually"), substantial manual work was done to ensure the code was clean, effective, and met personal specifications.

### Code Refinements and Styling

1.  **Refactoring and Cleanup:** Removed all unnecessary or redundant class names and inline styles generated by the AI to ensure a clean, semantic HTML structure.
2.  **Naming Convention:** Replaced AI-generated class names with clear, easy-to-read, and consistent BEM-like (Block-Element-Modifier) class names for maintainability.
3.  **Responsiveness Overhaul:** Manually checked and refined all CSS Media Queries to ensure flawless layout and performance across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports, which required custom adjustments beyond the AI's output.
4.  **Custom Color Palette:** Adjusted the color variables and font families to match my chosen personal brand aesthetic.

### Content and Functional Implementation

1.  **Personal Information:** The entire content section (About Me, Skills, Experience) was manually written and integrated into the structure.
    * **Name:** **[Navjot Kaur]**
2.  **Navigation and Links:** All internal and external links were manually added and verified.
    * **Social Media Links:** All social media icon links were implemented and connected manually:
        * **Gmail** [mailto:navjot.kour.277@gmail.com]
        * **Linkedin** [https://www.linkedin.com/in/navjot-kaur-31401336a/]
        * **Github** [https://github.com/navjot-kaur277]
        * **X (Twitter):** [https://x.com/navjotkaur2707]
3.  **Accessibility (A11y):** Ensured proper semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`) and added ARIA attributes where needed for improved accessibility scores, going beyond the AI-generated code.
